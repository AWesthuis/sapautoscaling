- Choose columns for Primary key and Finish

![step3wizard](../../images/step3_key.PNG)

- Save and generate the service using the Generate Runtime Objects option at the top

- Redefine the GET_ENTTITYSET method to fetch data based on filter. Sample code is shown below (Replace the table name with **/sdf/smon_header** if SMON is being used). We are not going to use the other methods in this demo so we will leave them empty. Save and activate the objects

``` abapcode
data: lv_osql_where_clause type string.
lv_osql_where_clause = io_tech_request_context->get_osql_where_clause( ).
select * from /sdf/mon_header
      into corresponding fields of table @et_entityset
      where (lv_osql_where_clause).
```
- Register and activate the service using transaction /IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE in gateway system.
- Check using the gateway client that you are able to query the service based on filter crtieria. See below for example
